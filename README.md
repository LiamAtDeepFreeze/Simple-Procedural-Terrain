# Simple-Procedural-Terrain

This is a very basic example of how to code a grid of terrains in Unity using procedural noise. Its just a bare bones implementation and is not particularly optimized in any way. This is only meant as a introduction into the methods needed to create procedural terrain. The project demonstrates the following features.

- How to create a height map from fractal noise and apply it to a terrain from a script

- How to create and apply a control map to a terrain from a script

- How to create and apply tree prototypes to a terrain from a script

- How to create and apply detail prototype layers to a terrain from a script

- How to create multiple terrains from a script and combine them to make one large terrain.
